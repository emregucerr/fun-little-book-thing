[sighs] The rest of Amodei’s life has, in some ways, been dedicated to addressing his father’s loss. Within four years, a new breakthrough turned the illness from something 50% fatal to 95% curable. “There was someone who worked on the cure to this disease, that managed to cure it, and save a bunch of people’s lives,” he says, “but could have saved even more.”

Jade Wang, who dated him in the early 2010s, says his father’s passing shaped his path. “It’s the difference between his father most likely dying and most likely living, okay?” It just took time before he found AI as the vessel.

Upon recalling his father’s death, he grows animated. [sarcastic] “I get really angry when someone’s like, ‘This guy’s a doomer. He wants to slow things down,’” Amodei tells me. [firm] “You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.”
