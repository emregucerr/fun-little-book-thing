Still, OpenAI entrusted Amodei with the leadership of the GPT-3 project, handing him 50–60% of the entire company’s compute to build a massively scaled-up language model. The jump from GPT to GPT-2 was large, a ten-fold increase. The jump from GPT-2 to GPT-3 would be massive — a 100x project costing tens of millions of dollars. The results were stunning. Independent researchers were surprised by GPT-3’s ability to code, summarize, and translate. [excited] “It has this emergent quality,” Amodei told the Times. “It has some ability to recognize the pattern that you gave it and complete the story.”

But cracks beneath the surface at OpenAI began to tear wide open.
