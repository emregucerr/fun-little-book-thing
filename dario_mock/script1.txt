A Curable Illness

[sober] Dario Amodei was a science kid. Born in San Francisco in 1983 to a Jewish mother and an Italian father, he was interested almost entirely in math and physics. When the dot-com boom exploded around him in his high school years, it barely registered. “Writing some website actually had no interest to me whatsoever,” he tells me. “I was interested in discovering fundamental scientific truth.”

At home, he was very close with his parents, a loving couple who sought to improve the world. His mother, Elena Engel, ran renovation and construction projects for libraries in Berkeley and San Francisco. His father, Riccardo Amodei, was a trained leathersmith. “They gave me a sense of right and wrong and what was important in the world,” he says, “imbuing a strong sense of responsibility.”

That sense of responsibility showed up at Caltech, where he lambasted fellow students over their passivity toward the forthcoming Iraq war. “The problem isn’t that everyone is just peachy with the idea of bombing Iraq; it’s that most people are opposed in principle but refuse to give one millisecond of their time,” he wrote. “This needs to change, right now and without delay.”

[softly] Then, in his early 20s, his life changed forever. His father, who’d long fought a rare illness, lost the battle in 2006. Riccardo’s passing shocked Amodei, and he shifted his graduate studies at Princeton from theoretical physics to biology to address human illness and biological problems.
