Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete, the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.

There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army: [whispers] (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant that it cannot obey—hobbling the army. (2) By attempting to govern an army as he administers a kingdom, ignorant of conditions—this causes restlessness in the soldiers’ minds. (3) By employing officers without discrimination, ignorant of adaptation—this shakes confidence. [exhales] When the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come. This is bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.

Thus we may know five essentials for victory: [whispers] He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. [sighs] Hence the saying: [whispers] If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
